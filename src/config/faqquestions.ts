	{
		question: "How does contributing work in practice?",
		answer: `Coin packs: Available in 90, 180, 365, or 366 coins. Each coin = Rs1 of impact.
Daily rule: At least 1 coin must move every day - handled automatically.
Flexibility: Support 1 to 11 projects; switch or shuffle anytime.
Transparency: Every coin is traceable on your dashboard - no black box accounting.`,
	},
	{
		question: "How do I purchase coins?",
		answer: `Sign in and choose a pack.
Pay via UPI, card, or net-banking (all PCI-DSS encrypted).
Coins appear instantly.
Heads-up: Standard payment-gateway fees and GST are added at checkout and are covered by the contributor - no hidden extras later`,
	},
	{
		question: "How does daily contribution work?",
		answer: `Contributing at least 1 coin per day is mandatory.

You can enable auto-contribution in two ways:

By selecting a project category: The system will automatically contribute 1 coin daily to an active project within that category.
By selecting specific projects: Contributors can enable auto-contribution for up to 11 projects.`,
	},
	{
		question:
			"What happens if a project I support reaches its goal or expires?",
		answer: `Don't sweat it - we'll:

Pause that project's daily collection immediately.
Notify you (email + in-app alert).
Let you pick a new project whenever you are ready.
Your other auto-contributions keep flowing as usual`,
	},
	{
		question: "What if I don't choose a replacement project?",
		answer: `That coin simply waits on standby. The platform never reassigns your money without your say-so.`,
	},
	{
		question: "How do I track my contribution?",
		answer: `Contributors will receive one daily notification summarizing all the projects they supported that day.

Daily digest: A quick ping telling you, "Rs1 went to ABC Project today."
Dashboard: Live balances, list of active auto-projects, referral stats, and a running "impact meter" that totals every rupee you have ever sent.`,
	},
	{
		question: "What happens if my coin balance hits zero?",
		answer: `Auto-contributions pause automatically - no penalties, no surprise charges. Reload coins anytime and your streak picks up right where it left off.`,

	{
		question: "Who can use 1RupeeProject?",
		answer: `There are four types of users:

Contributors (Coin Rebels) - Individuals who buy coins and contribute daily to support projects.
Project Owners - Creators, including NGOs, individuals, and social impact organizations, who submit their initiatives for funding.
Corporate Partners - Companies that collaborate on large-scale impact projects, contribute funds, or empanel their entire staff to contribute & volunteer through 1RupeeProject.

		question: "How is my data protected?",
		answer: `Military-grade encryption, no data-selling, and you control what's public. We have got your back.`,
	},

export const gamificationqa = [
	{
		question: "How does the referral system work?",
		answer: `Share your unique code; each signup you inspire earns you badges and, soon, reward points. More changemakers = more kudos for you..`,
	},
	{
		question: "What rewards can I earn?",
		answer: `You earn badges and Karma points for reaching milestones. You earn points for each action like referring someone, contributing to projects and creating projects. Referral and contribution based rewards are being developed.

A full points-and-perks Karma Store is brewing - stay tuned.`,

export const managingqa = [
	{
		question: "How do I activate auto-contribution?",
		answer: `You can activate auto-contribution in two ways:

Project Category: The system automatically contributes 1 coin daily to any active project within the selected category.
Specific Project: Users can enable and add auto-contribution for up to 11 specific projects at a time.
Thats it; we handle the daily transfers.`,
	},

	},
	{
		question:
			"Can I add or remove individual projects from auto-contribution?",
		answer: `Yes! You can add, remove, or replace projects at any time.

The system allows up to 11 active auto-contributions (combination of project categories and specific projects)..`,
	},
	{
		question: 'What about "Yearly Ongoing Funding" projects?',
		answer: `These never expire. Your daily coin flows indefinitely until you decide to remove them from auto-contribute. Perfect for long-term causes.`,
	},
];
export const payemtqa = [
	{
		question: "Can I get a refund on unused coins?",
		answer: `Coins cannot be refunded, but they will always end up helping a project via your chosen category, so no rupee ever sits idle forever.`,
	},
	{
		question: "Can I transfer my coins to another user?",
		answer: `No - coins stay tied to your wallet.`,

export const projectqa = [
	{
		question: "How are projects vetted and verified?",
		answer: `Every submission jumps through three hoops:

Document check (registrations, audits, bank proofs).
Impact audit (field calls with beneficiaries).
Ongoing milestones (spend receipts before each payout).
Only the best clear all stages - it's trust or bust.`,
	},
	{
		question: "Can I submit my own project?",
		answer: `Yes! NGOs, startups, even individual changemakers can apply via Submit a Project. The same strict vetting applies to everyone.`,
	},
	{
		question: "What happens after submission?",
		answer: `Admin review (we may ask clarifying questions).
Approval & go-live.
Funding via one of three models:
Ongoing: coins flow daily.
Goal-based: funds release once the target is hit.
Term-based: funds release at campaign end.`,
	},
	{
		question: "How do projects receive funding?",
		answer: `Projects can be funded in three ways:

Yearly / Ongoing Funding - No set goal, projects keep receiving funds.
Goal-Based Funding - A target amount is set.
Term-Based Funding - Contributions are accepted for a specific period.`,

export const questionqa = [
	{
		question: "What is 1RupeeProject?",
		answer: `1RupeeProject, India's first micro-giving movement.

In simple terms, we are a Rs1-a-day giving platform. Buy a digital coin pack once, and every day the system moves Rs1 from that pack to the project(s) you have chosen - no forms, no fuss. Over weeks and months, those tiny, automatic contributions build classrooms, lay water pipelines, fund art programmes - proof that pocket change can spark giant change. Setup takes under a minute on any phone or laptop.`,
	},
	{
		question: "How does it work, exactly?",
		answer: `Buy a coin pack with UPI, card, or net-banking (coins land in your wallet instantly).
Daily magic: We auto-transfer Rs1 per project every single day until you:
- top up more coins,
- switch projects, or
- hit pause.
Pick up to 11 projects you love - education, health, environment, the arts, animal welfare, and more.
You will get regular project updates and impact reports, so you always know where your rupee went.`,
	},
	{
		question: "Who can contribute?",
		answer: `Anyone aged 18+ living in India with a digital payment method - whether you are a student with a prepaid wallet or a professional armed with a credit card. All you need is Rs1 and the will to help.`,
	},
	{
		question: "Why only Rs1 per project per day?",
		answer: `Two simple reasons:
- Accessibility: Almost everyone can spare a rupee, so nobody's left out.
- Habit-forming impact: When thousands of contributors give tiny amounts every day, projects enjoy steady cash flow instead of sporadic lump sums. Consistency beats size.`,
	},

export const supportqa = [
	{
		question: "How many projects can I support simultaneously?",
		answer: `Minimum: 1 (your mandatory daily contribution).
Maximum: 11 (any mix of categories + specific projects).`,
	},
	{
		question: "Can I back multiple categories?",
		answer: `Yes. Each category you add counts toward the 11-slot cap just like an individual project.`,

export const transactionqa = [
	{
		question: "Where is my money kept before it reaches a project?",
		answer: `All coins sit in a secure, non-interest-bearing trustee wallet - ring-fenced from company operations - until transferred to the project or released at goal/term completion.`,
	},
	{
		question: "Do I receive any tax benefit for contributing?",
		answer: `Not at the moment. We are exploring Section 80G partnerships, but today your Rs1 is purely for impact, not deductions.`,
	},
	{
		question: "Which payment methods can I use to buy coins?",
		answer: `UPI, major credit/debit cards, and net-banking (final list confirmed at launch). Every transaction is SSL-encrypted and PCI-DSS compliant.`,
	},
	{
		question: "Are there extra charges?",
		answer: `Yes, standard payment gateway transaction fees and government taxes apply when you contribute.

For every Rs1 you give:

90 paise goes directly to the project.
10 paise helps sustain the platform by covering operational costs.
Full breakdown shown before you pay.`,
	},
	{
		question: "When does a project actually get the money?",
		answer: `Ongoing model: instantly, coin by coin.
Goal/term model: in one lump-sum after the goal or term completes.`,
